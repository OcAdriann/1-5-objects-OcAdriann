# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
Shallow clones copies the properties at the first level and references for nested objects. Therefore, if the original object has nested objects, changes to these nested objects will affect both the original and copied objects. This can lead to unexpected results and bugs in your code.
