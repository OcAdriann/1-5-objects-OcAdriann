Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{

  isCool: true,

# Answer
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, The example is not valid JSON because JSON requires everything to be within quotes as a string.
